## Build Setup

This is only needed if you want to build/change your own version. If you want to use it without modification, see: _use as static website_

_The config.js, data.js and photos folder used for development are in the \static folder_

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev


# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
static output will be place in \dist folder, copy this to any location
```
